\begin{document}
	Consider any $S\in \lam$. Let $S_1,\dots, S_k$ be the strongly connected components of $S$ in topological order. 
	We know that
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item $x(\delta^-(S_1)) \geq 1$; as $x$ is a feasible solution to $\LP(G,w)$,
		\item $x(\delta^-(S)) = 1$; as the primal constraint for $S$ is tight,
		\item Every edge into $S_1$ is also an edge into $S$.
	\end{enumerate}
	It follows that $x(\delta^-(S_1)) = 1$. 
	Using induction along with a similar argument, one can also see that for all $i$, $x(\delta^-(S_i)) = x(\delta^+(S_i)) = 1$ and, the only edges from one SCC to another are edges that go from $S_i$ to $S_{i + 1}$. 
	As a consequence, there will always exist a path from $u\in S_{in}$ to $v\in S_{out}$ within $S$.
	
	This structure allows us to "shortcut" paths that enter or exit $S$ multiple times. Consider a path $P$ that enters $S$ for the first time at $u_1$ and last exits $S$ from $v_k$ then, we can replace the entire portion of $P$ between $u_1$ and $v_k$ with a $u_1 - v_k$ path completely inside $S$.\\
	
	\begin{lemma}\label{lemm:2:SiAgree}
		For any SCC $S_i \in S$, $\lam \cup S_i$ is also a laminar familiy.
	\end{lemma}
	\begin{proof}
		Assume for contradiction that $\lam \cup S_i$ 
	\end{proof}
	
	\begin{definition}\label{def:value}
		Let $\bm{\textbf{\val}_\calI(S)}$ be the LP value of $\calI$ stored within $S$, and let $\bm{\textbf{\val}(\calI)}$ be the total LP value of $\calI$. Formally, 
		\[
			\bm{\textbf{\val}_\calI(S)}:=\sum\limits_{R\in \lam:R\subsetneq S}2\cdot y_R\qquad \bm{\textbf{\val}(\calI)}:=\val_\calI(V)
		\]
	\end{definition}
	
	\begin{definition} 
		Let $\bm{d_S(u,v)}$ be the weight of the shortest path from $u$ to $v$ inside $S$. Also, let 
		\begin{equation}
			\bm{D_S(u,v)}:=\sum_{R\in \lam : u\in R\subsetneq S}y_R + d_s(u,v) + \sum_{R\in \lam : v\in R\subsetneq S}y_R\label{def:1}
		\end{equation}
		Furthermore, let $\bm{D_{\max}(S)} := \max_{u \in S_{in}, v \in S_{out}}D_S(u,v)$.
		
		Intuitively, $D_s(u,v)$ is paying the cost of entering $u$ from outside $S$, taking a shortest path from $u$ to $v$, and exiting from $v$ to outside $S$. See \hyperref[fig:Duv]{Figure \ref{fig:Duv}} for a visualization of this split of cost.\\
	\end{definition}

	\begin{lemma}\label{lemm:2:D-val} 
		$S\subseteq V$ be any set such that $\lam \cup \{S\}$ is a laminar family. 
		Then,
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item[(1)] $d_S(u,v)\leq \val_\calI(S)$ if there exists a $u-v$ path inside $S$.
			\item[(2)] $D_S(u,v)\leq \val_\calI(S)$ if $u\in S_{in}$ or $v\in S_{out}$
		\end{enumerate}
	\end{lemma}
	\begin{proof}
		The main idea for the proof for $(1)$ is that a path that enters some laminar set multiple times can be shortcut to just enter that laminar set once. 
		After repeatedly shortcutting until each laminar set is entered at most once, the cost of the path that each set $R$ is responsible for is at most $2\cdot y_R$ (one for entering $R$, and one for exiting $R$), and \textit{(1)} follows from the \hyperref[def:value]{definition of $\val_\calI(S)$}.\\
		The idea for \textit{(2)} is similar and one can show (using a case-by-case analysis) that for all $R\in \lam$ with $R\subsetneq S$, after shortcutting the path, at most two of the following are true:
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item $u\in R$
			\item $v\in R$
			\item The path enters $R$
			\item The path exits $R$
		\end{enumerate}
		In other words, every laminar set $R\subsetneq S$ appears at most twice in the right hand side of \hyperref[def:1]{Equation \ref{def:1}}. So, \textit{(2)} follows from the definition of $\val_\calI(S)$.
	\end{proof}
	
	This lemma gives us useful bounds on costs our algorithm will be incurring.
